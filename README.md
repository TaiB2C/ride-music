# Info for ride music
Field notes on how to play music safely during bike rides

I will use Markdown on GitHub, until I can figure out a better hosting situation.

## List of songs
More coming soon

## Bill of Materials (BOM)
* Bluetooth speaker: JBL [Flip 4](https://www.jbl.com/refurbished-speakers/JBL+Flip+4.html)
    * Last speaker in the [JBL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBL) Flip line with a [3.5mm audio jack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio))
    * Alternatively, any other [wireless speaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_speaker) that can safely stay on a bike will work
* [Cruiser Candy Coconut Bicycle Drink Holder](https://www.cruisercandy.com/shop/bicycle-drink-holders/new-all-natural-hand-made-coconut-bicycle-drink-holder-blank-face/)
    * Alternatively, any bike cup holder or bottle cage that can securely hold the Flip 4 will work
* Bike stem bag to hold phone
* Android music app: [Auxio](https://github.com/OxygenCobalt/Auxio)
* Music collection, sourced from:
    * [Bandcamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandcamp)
    * Lossless copies of [singles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)) from CDs, [converted](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/85455/convert-wav-music-library-to-flac-on-command-line-and-achieve-best-quality) from [WAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV) to [FLAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC)
    * Loss copies of singles obtained through... "economical means", as a former professor stated
    * Copies of songs only available by downloading with [`yt-dlp`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youtube-dl)

### Future component upgrades
* [Tangara](https://cooltech.zone/tangara/) from [Cool Tech zone](https://cooltech.zone/)
    * [Available](https://www.crowdsupply.com/cool-tech-zone/tangara) through [Crowd Supply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_Supply) during 2024
    * When Tangara finally ships, I hope this will allow me to separate music playing from smartphone usage
    * Auxio is great, but it's not safe to manage while riding a bike
    * I also expect Tangara to be somewhat more rugged against rain, compared to a smartphone's [USB-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C) charge port
* 1TB [microSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SD_card#microSD) card

## Roadmap
* I should probably use something more appropriate, like [Last&period;fm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last.fm), but I'll work on that
    * Alternatively, a FOSS equivalent will also work
* Use a [Creative Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons) license

Coming soon (likely a CC license)
