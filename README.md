# Ride music setup
Field notes on how to play music safely and mostly hands-free during group bike rides.

## Roadmap
* Figure out a hosting situation that's better than Markdown on GitHub.

## Playlist
* [Playlist](https://www.last.fm/user/TaiB2C/playlists/13228521) on my [last&period;fm account](https://www.last.fm/user/TaiB2C)
* TODO: YouTube playlist mirror
    * I may not be aware of entries missing if YouTube removes them.

## Bill of Materials (BOM)
This is what I use to play music on bike rides:

* Bluetooth speaker: JBL [Flip 4](https://www.jbl.com/refurbished-speakers/JBL+Flip+4.html)
    * Last speaker in the [JBL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBL) Flip line to have a [3.5mm audio jack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio))
    * Alternatively, any other [wireless speaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_speaker) that can safely stay on a bike will work
* Bungee cord on top of handlebar bag
* Bike stem bag to hold Tangara
* Music collection, sourced from:
    * [Bandcamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandcamp)
    * Lossless copies of [singles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)) from CDs or [converted](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/85455/convert-wav-music-library-to-flac-on-command-line-and-achieve-best-quality) from [WAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV) to [FLAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC)
    * Lossless copies of singles obtained through "economical means" (as a former professor says)
    * Lossy OPUS copies of songs only available by downloading with [`yt-dlp`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youtube-dl)
* [Tangara](https://cooltech.zone/tangara/) from [Cool Tech Zone](https://cooltech.zone/)
* Waterproof and crashproof case for Tangara
    * [Pelican Micro 1010 case](https://www.pelican.com/us/en/product/cases/micro/1010/)
        * Transparent lid for Bluetooth setups
    * Discontinued [Pelican i1010](https://www.pelican.com/us/en/product/cases/micro/1010/) with [1011 replacement case liner](https://www.pelican.com/us/en/accessory/cases/replacement-case-liner/1011/) (for in-production Micro 1010 case)
        * Opaque lids for wired audio jack setups
        * Audio jack dust cover (from the [Audio-Technica ATH-m50x](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-us/ath-m50x))
            * Protect Tangara from audio jack connector when not in use

### Future improvements
* 3D-printed DIY handlebar holder would be much better
    * Alternatively, any bike cup holder or bottle cage that can securely hold the Flip 4 will work
